# My custom startpage
This is a simple, minimal startpage I made to match my desktop's overall theme.

## Use
You can use the single page version as is with FireFox using the NewTab Override extension (it lets you upload one file to their servers, but only one). I do not use Chrome, so check r/startpages'wiki for more information.

I'm not a web developer, I only learned the basics of HTML and CSS on college and I haven't used them for a while. Don't hesitate to fork and modify to your liking. The scaling issues that were happening should be mostly fixed now (see the above pictures).

Thanks for checking this out :)


## Credits
I was inspired by [RamenMaestro's startpage](https://github.com/RamenMaestro/startpage).

The art is by [JimboJimSprites](https://www.deviantart.com/jimbojimsprites/art/Kurokiba-Ryo-DigitalDrawing-746609380).

I use [this](https://github.com/evanswa0606/firefox-simpletheme) CSS by evanswa0606 for my browser (Firefox). You might need to tweak it a little as it is optimized for macOS. On my setup, I also changed the colors to match my DE's theme.
